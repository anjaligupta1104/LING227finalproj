Authors: Anjali Gupta and Jade Villegas

Running this project requires several common dependencies, which can be installed via pip: ```nltk, sklearn, scipy, numpy```.

To run our model, just make sure that the data is downloaded to the same folder that the Python scripts are in and that the input paths to the data in each Python file are correct for your local folder setup.

Our implementation can be run by the following commands for each model:

Logistic regression: ```python LR_by_doc.py```

Naive Bayes: ```python ngram_NB.py```

N-gram LM: ```python ngram_MLE.py```
