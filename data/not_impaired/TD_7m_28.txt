&-um once there were <&~t> [/?] a boy and a girl .
their names were Lisa and Raymond .
when they got home from school their mother told them we are going
where would you like to go ?
they both shouted out Mcdonalds .
so they ran and hoped in the car .
and they were on their way to Mcdonalds .
Raymond and their <&~mo> [/?] mom both decided what they wanted
but Lisa did not know .
then she finally made up her mind and told the clerk .
I wanna happy meal with a drink please .
&-um and then the clerk said that'll be twelve fifty .
and then her mom reached to get her purse .
and she did not have the purse .
it was on the counter at home .
what should they do ?
there once was a boy getting up out_of bed .
his clock started ringing .
he shut it off went downstairs and had breakfast .
he poured the cereal then the milk .
but the milk spilled and made a mess .
then he went to put on his shoes .
the shoestrings broke .
so he tried to fix it .
after that he put on his sneakers .
and he went to the busstop .
the bus was already gone .
he hadta go chase after it .
and pretty soon the teacher said he was late for school .
there once were two children named <hm:> [/?] Melissa and Corbin .
they were hiking on a mountain once .
and they saw something in the sky .
it landed &-um close to them .
they ran behind a bush and peaked .
0 .
Corbin was a scaredy-cat to see .
Melissa was brave .
<so they> [/?] so Melissa &-um pulled Corbin .
<and> [/?] but he stayed still .
he would not go .
then it opened .
all of the sudden a family was coming out <a girl alien a boy &~a>
and a brother alien <was in> [/?] was still in the shuttle .
&-uh the dog was sniffing them and went towards them .
they saw them and they were scared .
they said what do you want with us ?
nothing .
we just came to visit your planet .
we're not trying to take anything .
a couple days after that they were robing stores .
so they lied .
