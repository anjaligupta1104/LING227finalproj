on tuesday the mom asked the kids if <&~sh> [/?] they wanted to go
and they said yes .
and she asked them where they wanted to eat .
and they <&~sai> [/?] both yelled Mcdonalds .
I don't remember the rest .
one day <uh um> [/?] Joe woke up .
and he was trying to pour milk into his cereal .
and he made a big mess .
and then he tried to tie his shoes .
and his shoelaces got broken .
and he missed the bus .
and he hadta run to school .
once these two kids were walking in a park .
and this thing that looked like a blimp landed there .
and aliens came out .
and [/] and Joey was scared .
but the girl wanted to say hi to them and probably pet the dog .
the aliens had lots_of spots on them .
