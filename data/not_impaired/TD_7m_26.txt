the boy was waking up .
and he went to get a glass of milk .
he went to tie his shoe .
and then it broke .
and then he missed the bus .
and he was late for school .
some kids were walking in the woods .
and they saw <a like> [/?] a thing in the sky .
and then it landed .
and then they went over to see .
and then they stopped and looked at it .
