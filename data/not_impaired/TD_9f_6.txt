and they drove to the nearest Mcdonalds .
and Raymond and the mom &-um knew what they wanted to eat .
but Lisa couldn't decide if she wanted a Big_Mac or a happy meal .

their mom wanted a salad .
and Lisa wanted <a um> [/?] a happy meal a coke and a chocolate
<and oh> [/?] and Raymond wanted french fries and <a big &~sh uh
and &-um then the clerk said it'll be twelve dollars and fifty
and the mom reached for her purse .

and so [% child laughs] um I don't know +...
this boy wakes up .
and he looks like he might be late or something .
and he tries to &-um pour his milk .
and he's hurrying so much .
and he's looking at the clock so much that <he um> [/?] he forgets
and he spills the milk over .
and &-um then he tries to tie his shoe .
and he's so frustrated and trying to hurry up that they break .
and then he [/] he tries to run to school .
&-um he tries to run to the school that the school bus stopped .
but the school bus has already left .
