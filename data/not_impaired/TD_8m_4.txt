<&~mc> [/?] Lisa and Raymond yelled Mcdonalds .
okay [/?] so Lisa and Raymond's mom hauled them <to Mcdonalds> [/?]
and as they walked into the <&~s> [/?] restaurant Lisa didn't know
mom and Raymond already knew what they were gonna have .
okay [/?] Raymond <&~wan had> [/?] said he'll have <a okay> [/?] a
mom was just gonna have a salad .
and Lisa had <and Lisa had a a a okay a &~chees> [/?] a happy meal
and then the clerk said that it all adds up to twelve fifty .
his mom reached out for her purse it wasn't there .
then she remembered that she had left it on the kitchen counter .

one morning I'm guessing this guy oh wait +...
I'm gonna call this story Late_For_School .

then <oh what was it oh yeah> [/?] Sam didn't make it to the bus
then when he gotta school his teacher was very disappointed because
so the day went on normal except for Sam <because &-um um> [/?]
and the end .
that's all I can remember .
I did one with these pictures .
this one was when he broke his shoelace .
this one he was rushing his breakfast .
this one found out that he was late for school .
that one was the one when he was running late .
and he [/] he didn't catch the bus on time .
[^ tape cuts out] when the teacher was very disappointed .
and then when he was late to school .
okay [/?] one day <simon and Jan I mean &-uh > [/?] Tim and Jan
and then they heard a strange rumbling noise behind those bushes in
and then when they looked over they saw a <&~s> [/?] big spaceship
and then out came aliens .
they were from the planet Jinga &=laughs I'm guessing .
and there were about <four people> [/?] three people who actually
there was a father a mother and a little kid .
and they had a dog too that looked very strange .
<so> [/?] and Jan <she was she &~lov> [/?] she loved aliens so she
but then Tim stopped her .
<she> [/?] he said no don't go .
<how do you what do> [/?] how do you know these aliens are friendly
what if they're trying to take over the world ?
don't be silly Tim .
those aliens probably just people dressed up in [/] in costumes and
<no Michelle &~wu I mean I mean what was her name Jan> [/?] no Jan
don't be silly there's nothing wrong with them .
I mean <they're> [/?] they look pretty nice and <they> [/?]
still we shouldn't go and do it .
still we shouldn't go see them .
we should go tell mom and dad .
so they ran home to go tell mom and dad .
and when they got there only the children saw the aliens .
mother and father didn't see anything but just people .
and a big giant truck .
then to them oh +...
<so they> [/?] so Tim and Jan still wondered if they were still
uh is that longer than yours ?
