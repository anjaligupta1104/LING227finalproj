okay but I can't remember the whole thing .
as_soon_as Raymond and <um (6.)> [/?] the little girl got home from
<the> [/?] where do you wanna eat ?
and <the> [/?] both of the children yelled out Mcdonalds .
so they hoped in the car .
and their mother drove them to Mcdonalds .
three the girl couldn't make up her mind .
mother and Raymond knew what they wanted .
the mother said I will have a salad with &-um a drink .
Raymond said I am going to have a hamburger with fries and a
the girl finally made up her mind .
she said I want a hamburger with ketchup and a <chocolate &~va>
then the clerk said will that be all ?
they said yes .
and he said it will be twelve fifty .
when the mother reached for her purse it wasn't there .
ah no .
better think about this one .
thirty six I think I'm ready now .
there once was a boy who hadta be up by six thirty .
he looked at his clock .
and it was seven o'clock .
he slept in .
so he ran downstairs poured his milk ate his breakfast very quickly
when he got dressed his shoelace broke .
he missed the school bus .
then he ran to school and was late .
okay .
let's see if I can remember my story .
one day there was a boy and a girl playing tag in the park .
the boy was it .
and the girl was running from him .
just then an alien spaceship landed on the earth .
an alien family came out and talked a language they did not know .
after about a week the aliens decided to go back home .
the girl wanted to touch them .
but the boy wouldn't let her .
when they left they forgot their pets .
so the next day they came back and took their pet with them .
then they flew off into space again .
and lived happily ever after on their own planet .
