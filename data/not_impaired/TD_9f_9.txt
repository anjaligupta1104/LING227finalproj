and they both yelled Mcdonalds .
so they jumped in the car .
and their mother drove them to Mcdonalds .
Lisa didn't know what to order .
her brother ordered a vanilla shake hamburger .
and &-um their mother <&~or> [/?] ordered a salad .
then Lisa made up her mind and said she wanted a happy meal a
and the clerk said that that was twelve fifty .
when her mother &-um reached out to get her purse <she um> [/?] she
one day <&~the um> [/?] a boy named Ryan <um woke um> [/?] woke up
and he &-uh woke up late because his alarm clock he forgot to set
and it didn't go off .
and he rushed to get his breakfast .
and since he was almost late for school he &-um rushed <&~tru> [/?]
then he broke his &-um shoelace when he was tying his shoes <&~s>
and when he was done he left to the bus stop .
and he saw that the bus was leaving .
and he ran after it .
but he couldn't catch up .
and &-um then he finally came to school because he was running .
and his teacher said that he is five minutes late .
there once was a boy and a girl named Daniel and &-um Karina .
and they were going out &-um through the woods &-um so they &-um
and &-um they heard &-uh some sounds over there .
and they were wondering what it is .
so they went behind a bush .
and they were peeking .
and they saw a &-um spaceship just landed there and some <um> [/?]
&-um and Karina said those are aliens !
and Daniel didn't believe her .
he said but there's no such thing as aliens .
and she said look for yourself .
and he saw .
and he was afraid .
then the aliens heard them .
and they came over to see what was happening .
and Karina and Daniel were afraid .
so instead of running they tried to &-um tell them what happened .
and the aliens understood .
and the aliens told Karina and Daniel to promise to keep this a
